1. Single Responsibility Principle
   1. Every class or structure should have only one responsibility
   2. Every software module should have only one reason to change
2. Open Closed Principle
   1. A class is open for extension but closed for modification
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
   1. You should be able to use any derived class instead of a parent class and have it behave in the same manner without modification
5. Interface Segregation Principle
   1. Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use. Instead of one fat interface, many small interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods, each one serving one submodule.
7. Dependency Inversion Principle
   1. High-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes
