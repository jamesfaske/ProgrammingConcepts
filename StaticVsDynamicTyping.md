1. Statically Typed Language (C, C++, c#, Java, Go, Scala, F#)
   1. Types are checked at compile time
   2. type is bound to the variable
   3. Pros
      1. Less bug prone since types are checked at compile time
      2. Java and C# can use reflection to change data type based on data
   4. Cons
      1. Have to use type conversion to operate between two differently typed variables
      2. Less prone to bugs
2. Dynamically Typed Language (Javascript, Python, R, Ruby, Clojure, Powershell)
   1. Types are checked at run time
   2. Type is bound to the value
   3. Pros
      1. Faster programming (don't have to worry about types)
      2. Good for scripting or prototyping
      3. good for systems where data changes regularly
   4. Cons
      1. More bug prone
      2. Potential runtime failures since type conversions are not checked at compile time
